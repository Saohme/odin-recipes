<h2>Pulled Pork</h2>

<p>This Texas-style pulled pork recipe has a tangy barbeque 
    sauce that's easy to make in the slow cooker. I like to 
    serve the shredded pork on toasted buttered rolls. My 
    family's favorite!</p>

<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour vegetable oil into the bottom of a slow cooker. 
            Place pork roast into the slow cooker; pour in barbeque 
            sauce, vinegar, and chicken broth. Stir in brown sugar, 
            yellow mustard, Worcestershire sauce, chili powder, onion, 
            garlic, and thyme. Cover and cook on Low for 10 to 12 hours 
            or High for 5 to 6 hours until pork shreds easily with a fork.</li>
        <li>Remove pork from the slow cooker, and shred the meat 
            using two forks. Return shredded pork to the slow cooker, 
            and stir to combine with juices.</li>
        <li>Spread the inside of both halves of hamburger buns with 
            butter. Toast buns, butter-side down, in a skillet over 
            medium heat until golden brown. Spoon pulled pork into 
            toasted buns.</li>
